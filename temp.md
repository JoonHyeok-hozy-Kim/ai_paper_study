I prefer the direct hiring.

<br>

I am a single.

<br>


Philadelphia, PA or the nearby area such as Cherry Hill, New Jersey will be perfect for me.

<br>


Hospitals and dialysis centers are preffered.

<br>


I work in the 큰길 clinic in the Seoul City.

<br>


There are 44 beds and this clinic is the largest dialysis center in the Seoul City.

<br>


The ratio is 6 to 1. I mean One nurse for six patients.

<br>


I work for 8 hours a day, from 6AM to 2PM.

<br>

Not yet, but I am studying to get sufficient scores on both TOEIC and TOEFL. 
For the visa screening, I will take the TOEIC test first. 
And then, I will get the TOEFL score for the endorsement to Pennsylvania.

<br>

No, I don't drive. 
I don't have the license yet but I will get the Korean license before moving to the United States.

<br>

I visited the US twice for academic programs, but I did not received visa such as J1 or F1. I also checked the US enterence record for sure. They were probably just the ESTA visits.

<br>

I agree with your opinion that I do not have sufficient amount of experience as a dialysis nurse. But I am really satisfied with my new career and determined to continue this until I move to the US. As long as I know, the greencard sponsorship process usually takes one to two years. So I thought it would be reasonable to contact Connetics as soon as possible to get the priority.
