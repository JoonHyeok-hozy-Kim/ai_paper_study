Recall the Maclaurin series of the function $e^{tx}$ is   
![](./images/004.png)   

Thus, the MGF can be denoted as   
Taking the derivative of the MGF, we obtain   
Evaluating the derivative at $t=0$, we have   
Taking the second derivative and evaluating at $t=0$,   
Continuing in this manner, we obtain all the moments to be
