## 1.3 Sampling Schemes

* Concept) Census Study
  * A study in which the entire population is included.
  * It is usually not possible to obtain information on the entire population

* Concept) Sample
  * Props)
    * Obtained by collecting information from only some members of the population
    * A good sample must reflect all the characteristics (of importance) of the population.
  * Types
    * Representative Sample
      * A sample that accurately reflects its population characteristics
    * Biased Sample
      * A sample that is not representative of the population characteristics
