## 1.1 MATRICES AND VECTORS

#### Def) Matrix (plural, matrices)
* A rectangular array of scalars. 
* If the matrix has m rows and n columns, we say that the size of the matrix is m by n, written m Ã— n. 
* The matrix is square if m = n. 
* The scalar in the ith row and jth column is called the (i, j)-entry of the matrix.

#### Def) Submatrix
* A submatrix of a matrix M is obtained by deleting from M entire rows, entire columns, or both.

* Row Vector : A matrix that has exactly one row
* Column Vector : A matrix that has exactly
one column
* Vector : Either a row vector or a column vector
* Components : The entries of a vector
