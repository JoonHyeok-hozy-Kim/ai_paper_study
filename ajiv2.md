I think I work best in environments where hands-on leadership and 
self-sufficiency are balanced. 
For example, I am in charge of a group consisted of 6 patients,
 and I independently provide treatment from start to finish. 
But I am also open to seeking advice from my supervisor
 on complex cases or adjusting dialysis schedules.

# 5)리더쉽- 리더거나, 팀원 일 때
- When I am a leader, I quickly prioritize tasks and delegate them efficiently. 
On the other hand, if I am a follower,
 I follow my leader’s directions responsibly and 
keep my leader informed of important matters.

# 5)리더쉽- Unexpected work?
- I remember one day when a nursing assistant was out sick. 
The clinic was short-staffed, 
so I was asked to help with bed making 
and sterilizing medical equipment.
 It was a busy day, but I was able 
to complete all my tasks. I was happy to help my team.


# 6. 트러블 환자랑
One day, a patient attempted to touch me in a sexually inappropriate way.

I politely but firmly asked(에스드) him to refrain from such unwanted contact.

Unfortunately, the patient persisted.

Although I felt uncomfortable, 
I prioritized(프라이오리타이즈드) the safety of other patients.
	
In order not to agitate them, I calmly reported the incident to my supervisor.

It was a very difficult experience, but
 I learned how to deal with such challenging situations.
(It was determined that the patient's care would be better managed at another facility.)

# 7.  conflict
7)conflict - Doctor or 동료 
Once, I had a patient who needed to set dialysis ultrafiltration rate for 3kg, 
but his initial blood pressure was lower than usual,( around 100 millimeters of mercury systolic.) 
So, I decided to start the machine at 2.5kg,
planning to gradually increase it as the patient's blood pressure stabilized.

However, the doctor on rounds was not aware 
of the patient’s condition
 and continuously urged me to change the setting.

I was worried that arguing in front of the patient 
would make him anxious, 
so I took the doctor aside to discuss the situation. 

It turned out that the doctor thought 
I had mistakenly set the ultrafiltration rate on the machine. 

I explained that I had lowered the rate 
due to the patient's low initial blood pressure 
and was planning to monitor their blood pressure
 before increasing it.

 We were able to understand each other's perspectives
 and resolve the issue.
 
So, I think that effective communication is 
essential for resolving conflicts.
(일반적)
To begin with, we often work under high pressure, so I try not to take anything personally. 
Instead, I think communication is the most important key.
so I would ask the colleague who I am in trouble with to have a conversation with me. 
Then, I would actively listen to his or her situation and try to understand that person’s perspective. 
If we cannot resolve the problem and it affects the patient care,
I would then involve a supervisor by following the chain of command.


# 8. 가장 큰 첼린지 ? [나중에 보완 전직.]
- Starting a new career in the dialysis center,
 performing invasive procedures such as cannulation was most challenging.
For example, one day, a patient complained during the procedure.
 
Of course, I understood that he experienced discomfort(컴) during the procedure.
 
 So, I actively listened to his feelings and tried to be empathetic,
 while offering sincere apologies.
 
However, I realized that empathy(엠퍼띠) alone wasn’t enough.
 
To minimize patient discomfort and risk,
I practiced a lot using plastic cannulation tubes.
 
Today, most patients are satisfied with my technique.(니)
I was happy when the same patient later told me
 that he was satisfied with my care. 

This challenging experience taught me the importance of empathy 
and finding solutions collaboratively.
(I believe that being able to perform all aspects of dialysis
 allows me to provide optimal experience for my patients.)


# 9. 실수
When I was working in the dialysis clinic for about two months,
a patient experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure 
at the end of the hemodialysis treatment. 
So, I quickly(쿠이클리) stopped the treatment. 	

After the patient recovered and left the clinic,
I realized I had missed administering an erythropoietin(이리쓰로포이에틴) injection. 

I became very nervous, wondering what if something went wrong.
Still, I reported the incident to a senior nurse without hesitation. 

We decided to administer the injection
during the next treatment with the doctor’s confirmation.
This was because the patient received the injection once a week.

This incident reinforced my belief in the importance of honesty.

# 10 스트레스 해결방법
I love riding a bicycle and I’m a huge foodie.
These days, I enjoy going to cafes and restaurants by bicycle. 
I can eat delicious food and burn off those extra calories at the same time.
# 8) 스트레스 -간호사로서 스트레스
- As nurses, we have a big responsibility to keep our patients safe.
Thus, we have to be extra careful. 
To minimize errors, I prioritize tasks and double-check critical aspects.

# 11 취미
I love traveling and riding a bicycle. 
So I enjoy going on a bicycle trip on weekends.

# 12. 5년 후 계획
In the next five years, I want to pursue a Master’s degree
 in Adult Gerontology 재런탈러지 Care 
to enhance(인헨스) my nursing care skills and knowledge for dialysis patients. 

Also, I hope to buy a small house in the  US

# 13. 간호사가 된 이유
I went into nursing 
because I'm passionate about taking care of others 
and helping them.
11)간호사-모험
- I want to gain diverse clinical experience 
to expand my skills and knowledge. 

Ultimately, my career goal is to specialize in acute dialysis nursing.

# 14. 미국에 오고 싶은 이유
I believe that I can further develop my career and work 
in a good environment in the United States.

Besides, I am an adventurer and I like trying new things. 

Beautiful environments, pleasant weather, and
 kind people of the United States are attracting me. 

I am so thrilled to start a new journey there.

# 15. 메릴랜드
"I'm looking for a job in Maryland, Virginia, or Massachusetts. 
(Philadelphia or New Jersey. )
My top choice is Maryland.

I am familiar with Maryland because the 
famous Johns Hopkins and Georgetown University are there.
Also, my fiancé is studying in Philadelphia
Because Philadelphia and Maryland are close to each other,
I want to go to Maryland.
(While these regions are my top choices,
 I am also opened to opportunities in )

# 13)메릴랜드-계약기간
- A 24-month contract is okay with me because
 my fiancé is pursuing a doctor’s degree, 
which typically takes 5 to 6 years, in Philadelphia. 
Additionally, I am satisfied with my current role as a dialysis nurse.
13)메릴랜드-날씨
I'm okay with the weather of Maryland because 
I'm used to the four distinct seasons of South Korea.
In Korea, summers are very hot, and winters are very cool

# 16. 왜 너를?
- I am familiar with the Fresenius dialysis machine 
so I can quickly adapt to your facilities.
 Besides, in Korea, I worked without technicians supporting
 the dialysis treatment,

 so I can handle most of the situations during the treatment. 
Additionally, during the past six years back in the NICU,
 I sometimes led the team of nurses and 
this leadership experience will also be helpful.


# 17. 마무리 질문
Could you tell me the nurse-to-patient ratios at FMC?
May I ask you how long the orientation program is for new RNs typically at FMC? 
I'm curious about the specific locations within Maryland. 
Would it be possible for me to apply for a position in an acute dialysis unit?"

• Could you please let me know when I might expect to hear the result?
Thank you for taking the time to interview me.
(Could you describe the type orientation or training you provide to new hires?)
(Are there any opportunities to work in other regions besides Maryland?)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[신규추가]

# 18 테크니션이랑?
- We don’t have technicians in Korean dialysis centers. 
So, nurses deal with most of the dialysis procedures
 and control the machines. 
But if the machine does not work properly, 
we call Fresenius Korea specialists.

# 23. Disagreement with your manager
- As a team member, I believe in following leadership.
 In my experience, my supervisors have generally made sound decisions, 
which I've been happy to support. 
However, if I ever disagree with a decision,
 I would first try to understand the meaning behind it.
 If I still have concerns after discussing the matter,
 I would follow the chain of commands to address the issue.


# 25. 인지장애
- No, I haven’t. But I will learn from my colleagues how to deal with them and quickly get used to it.

# 26. 5am?
- I already start working at 6 am and it takes 
more than an hour to work now. So, 5 am will be okay with me.

# 14. acute
I want to apply for the acute dialysis hospital.
Sometimes, patients in very serious condition come into our clinic. 
But, I always felt so helpless when I couldn't treat them and had to send them
to a bigger hospital.
That's why I'm trying to transfer to a hospital in Korea 
to gain experience with a wider range of cases 
and improve my skills as a hemodialysis nurse.
It'll probably take about two years before I can land in the US,
so I'm going to make the most of my time in Korea 
to gain as much experience with acute cases as possible.
