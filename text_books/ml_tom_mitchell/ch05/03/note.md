# 5.3 Basics of Sampling Theory

#### Concept) The Central Limit Theorem
The Central Limit Theorem is a theorem stating that the sum of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables approximately follows a Normal distribution.

#### Concept) Estimator
An estimator is a random variable $Y$ used to estimate some parameter $p$ of an underlying population. 

<br>

#### Concept) Estimation Bias
a The estimation bias of $Y$ as an estimator for $p$ is the quantity $(E[Y] - p)$. 
- An **unbiased estimator** is one for which the bias is zero. 
- cf.) Estimation Bias vs Inductive Bias
  - The estimation bias is a numerical quantity.
  - The inductive bias is a set of assertions.

#### Concept) Confidence Interval
a A N% confidence interval estimate for parameter p is an interval that includes p with probability N%.
