# 4.3 Appropriate Problems for Neural Network Learning

### Concept) Problems Well-Suited to ANN
- Instances are represented by many attribute-value pairs. 
- The target function output may be discrete-valued, real-valued, or a vector of several real- or discrete-valued attributes.
- The training examples may contain errors.
  - The ANN learning methods are robust to noise
- Long training times are acceptable.
  - Network training algorithms typically require longer training times.
- Fast evaluation of the learned target function may be required.
  - Although ANN learning times are relatively long, evaluating the learned network is typically very fast.
- The ability of humans to understand the learned target function is not important
