# 9.6 Models of Evolution and Learning
What is the relationship between learning during the lifetime of **a single individual**, and the longer time frame **species-level** learning afforded by evolution?

## 9.6.1 Lamarckian Evolution
- Desc.)
  - Experiences of a single organism directly affected the genetic makeup of their offspring.
  - **Rejected** by the currently accepted view is that the genetic makeup of an individual is unaffected by the lifetime experience of one's biological parents.
  - Still, recent computer studies have shown that Lamarckian processes can sometimes improve the effectiveness of computerized genetic algorithms 
    - See *Grefenstette 1991*; *Ackley and Littman 1994*; and *Hart and Belew 1995*.

## 9.6.2 Baldwin Effect
- Desc.)
  - If a species is evolving in a changing environment, there will be evolutionary pressure to favor individuals with the **"capability to learn"** during their lifetime.
    - e.g.) if a new predator appears in the environment, then individuals capable of learning to avoid the predator will be more successful than individuals who cannot learn.
  - The ability to learn allows an individual to perform a small local search during its lifetime to maximize its fitness.
    - In contrast, nonlearning individuals whose fitness is fully determined by their genetic makeup will operate at a relative disadvantage.
  - Those individuals who are able to learn many traits can support a more diverse gene pool, relying on individual learning to overcome the "missing" or "not quite optimized" traits in the genetic code. 
  - This more diverse gene pool can, in turn, support more rapid evolutionary adaptation. 
  - Thus, the ability of individuals to learn can have an indirect accelerating effect on the rate of evolutionary adaptation for the entire population.
- Prop.)
  - The Baldwin effect provides an indirect mechanism for individual learning to positively impact the rate of evolutionary progress.
