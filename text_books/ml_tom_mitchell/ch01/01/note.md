A computer program is said to **learn** from experience $E$ with respect to some class of tasks $T$ and performance measure $P$, if its performance at tasks in $T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$.

  * Task $T$ : playing checkers
  * Performance measure $P$ : percent of games won against opponents
  * Training experience $E$: playing practice games against itself
