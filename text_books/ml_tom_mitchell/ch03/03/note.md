# 3.3 Appropriate Problems for Decision Tree Learning

### Concept) Best Suited Problems for Decision Tree Algorithms
1. Instances are represented by attribute-value pairs.
   - i.e.) discrete variables.
   - cf.) Extensions to the basic algorithms allow real variables as well.
2. The target function has discrete **output** values.
   - e.g.) "yes" or "no" for the [Play Tennis](../02/note.md#ex-play-tennis) example.
3. Disjunctive descriptions may be required.
   - Recall [the Prop. 3 of the Decision Tree](../02/note.md#prop-decision-tree).
4. The training data may contain errors.
   - i.e.) Decision tree learning methods are robust to both errors...
     - Errors in classifications of the training examples
     - Errors in the attribute values that describe these examples
5. The training data may contain missing attribute values.
   - i.e.) Decision tree methods can be used even when some training examples have unknown values
