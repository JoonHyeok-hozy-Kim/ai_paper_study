# 3.8 Expectation, Variance, and Covariance

### Concept) Expectation (Expected Value)
- Def.)
  - The **Expectation (Expected Value)** of some function $`f(x)`$ w.r.t. a probability distribution $`P(x)`$ is the average or mean value that $`f`$ takes on when $`x`$ is drawn from $`P`$.
- Notation)
  - $`\displaystyle \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x}\sim P} \left[ f(x) \right] = \sum_x P(x)f(x)`$
