#  3.7 Independence and Conditional Independence

### Concept) Independence
- Def.)
  - Two random variables are independent if their probability distribution can be expressed as a product of two factors.
- Notation)
  - $`x \perp y \Leftrightarrow p(\mathbf{x} = x, \mathbf{y} = y) = p(\mathbf{x} = x) p(\mathbf{y} = y)`$

### Concept) Conditional Independence
- Def.)
  - Two random variables $`x`$ and $`y`$ are conditionally independent given a random variable $`z`$ if the conditional probability distribution over $`x`$ and $`y`$ factorizes in this way for every value of $`z`$.
- Notation)
  - $`x \perp y | z \Leftrightarrow p(\mathbf{x} = x, \mathbf{y} = y | \mathbf{z} = z) = p(\mathbf{x} = x | \mathbf{z} = z) p(\mathbf{y} = y | \mathbf{z} = z)`$
