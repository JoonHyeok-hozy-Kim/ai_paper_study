# 2.11 The Determinant

### Concept) Determinant
- Def.)
  - A function mapping matrices to real scalars where its value is equal to the product of all the [eigenvalues](../07/note.md#concept-eigenvector-and-eigenvalue) of the matrix.
- Props.)
  - The absolute value of the determinant can be thought of as a measure of how much multiplication by the matrix expands or contracts space.
    - If the determinant is $0$, then space is contracted completely along at least one dimension, causing it to lose all of its volume. 
    - If the determinant is $1$, then  the transformation preserves volume.
