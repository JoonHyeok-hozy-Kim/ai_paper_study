# 2.3 Identity and Inverse Matrices

### Concept) Identity Matrix
- Def.)
  - An identity matrix is a matrix that does not change any vector when we multiply that vector by that matrix.
  - $`I_n \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \textrm{ such that } \forall x \in \mathbb{R}^n, I_n x = x`$

<br>

### Concept) Matrix Inverse
- Def.)
  - $`A^{-1} A = I_n`$
- Application)
  - System of Equations)
    - $`Ax= b`$
      - Sol.)
        - $`A^{-1}Ax = I_n x = x = A^{-1}b`$
