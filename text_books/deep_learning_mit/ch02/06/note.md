# 2.6 Special Kinds of Matrices and Vectors

### Concept) Diagonal Matrix
- Def.)
  - A matrix $`D`$ is diagonal iff. $`D_{i,j} = 0, \forall i,j \textrm{ such that } i\ne j`$

<br>

### Concept) Square Diagonal Matrix
- Def.)
  - $`\textrm{diag}(v)_{i,j}=\begin{cases}
      v_i & i=j \\
      0 & i\ne j
  \end{cases}`$
      - where
        - $`\textrm{diag}(v) \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}`$
        - $`v = \left[v_1, \cdots, v_n\right]\in \mathbb{R}^n`$$v\in \mathbb{R}^n$
- Props.)
  - For $`x\in \mathbb{R}^n`$
    - $`\textrm{diag}(v)x = \left[\begin{array}{c}
        v_1x_1 \\ v_2x_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_nx_n
    \end{array}\right] = v\odot x`$
  - Inverse exists only if every diagonal entry is nonzero.
    - $`\textrm{diag}(v)^{-1} = \textrm{diag}\left(\left[\frac{1}{v_1}, \cdots, \frac{1}{v_n}\right]\right)`$

<br>

### Concept) Symmetric Matrix
- Def.)
  - A symmetric matrix is any matrix that is equal to its own transpose.
    - i.e.) $`A = A^\top`$
- Prop.)
  - Symmetric matrices often arise when the entries are generated by some function of two arguments that does not depend on the order of the arguments.
    - e.g.)
      - $`A`$ is a matrix of distance measurement, with $`A_{i,j}`$ giving the distance from point $`i`$ to point $`j`$.

<br>

### Concept) Unit Vector
- Def.)
  - A unit vector is a vector with unit norm
    - i.e.) $`||x||_2 = 1`$

<br>

### Concept) Orthogonality
- Def.)
  - A vector $`x`$ and $`y`$ are **orthogonal** to each other if $`x^\top y 0`$.
- Prop.)
  - If both vectors have nonzero norm, this means that they are at a 90 degree angle to each other.
    - e.g.) $`\left[1,0\right]`$ and $`\left[0,1\right]`$

<br>

### Concept) Orthonormality
- Def.)
  - If the vectors are not only [orthogonal](#concept-orthogonality) but also have [unit norm](#concept-unit-vector), we call them **orthonormal**.

<br>

### Concept) Orthogonal Matrix
- Def.)
  - An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix whose rows are mutually orthonormal and whose columns are mutually orthonormal.
- Prop.)
  - For an orthogonal matrix $`A`$,
    - $`A^\top A = A A^\top = I`$
    - Thus, $`A^{-1} = A^\top`$
