## 0. Introduction
* Goal) Describing a new approach to automatic indexing and retrieval
  * Why doing this?
    * A fundamental problem in matching **words of queries** with **words of documents**
    * Users want to retrieve on the basis of **conceptual content**
    * **Individual words** provide unreliable evidence about the conceptual topic or meaning of a document. 
    * So the **literal terms** in a user's query may not match those of a relevant document.
    * Most words have **multiple meanings**, so terms in a user's query will literally match terms in documents that are not of interest to the user.
* Sol.) Treating the unreliability of observed term-document association data as a statistical problem
